 AI based hand gesture control is a system that is used to detect the gesture of hand in a 

real time video. The hand gesture can be restricted within a certain area of interest. In 

this study, designing hand gesture recognition is one of the complicated jobs that 

involves two major problems. Firstly, is the detection of the hand. Another problem is 

to create a sign that is suitable to be used one hand at a time. This project focuses on 

how a system could detect, recognize and interpret the hand gesture through computer 

vision with the challenges such as change in, location and scale. The image taken from 

the real time video is analyzed to detect the gesture of hand before the image processing 

is done. In this project, the detection of hand will be done using the theories of Python 

programming. The development of ai based hand gesture control using Python and 

OpenCV can be implemented by applying the theories of hand segmentation and the 

hand detection system. AI based hand gesture control is one of the systems that can 

detect the gesture of a hand in a real time video. Designing a system for hand gesture 

control is one of the goals of achieving the objectives of this project. The project has 

been made by our own efforts using python and OpenCV, mediapipe , pyautogui. The 

task of recognizing hand gesture control is one of the main and important issues in 

computer vision. With the latest advances in human interaction systems hand 

processing tasks such as hand detection and hand gesture control has evolved. Through

this project we came to know about the importance of teamwork and the role of 

devotion towards work.
